# Tools Repository 
Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) is a systematic process used to identify, analyze, and exploit security weaknesses in networks, systems, and 
applications. Vulnerability Assessment focuses on identifying and prioritizing vulnerabilities, while Penetration Testing simulates real-world attacks to exploit 
these vulnerabilities. Together, VAPT provides a comprehensive view of an organization's security posture. This approach helps mitigate risks, ensure compliance, and 
enhance overall resilience against cyber threats.
